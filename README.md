## What
Neapolitan is an app for music students, to assist them in part-writing using the "common practice" rules. It will be able to  identify the type and location of various part-writing errors, and will hopefully be able to flawlessly part-write examples given only a chord progression, eventually.

## Why
It's what I would've wanted when I was starting my music theory classes. Also, it's cool.
